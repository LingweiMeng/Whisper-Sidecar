## Data
### Overlapped multi-talker audio file generation
Please refer to:
- LibriMix: https://github.com/JorisCos/LibriMix
- LibriSpeechMix: https://github.com/NaoyukiKanda/LibriSpeechMix
- Aishell1Mix: https://github.com/huangzj421/Aishell1Mix

And organize the data list as jsonl files, such as `./Whisper-Sidecar/dataset/libri2mix_train.jsonl`

### Performing the Target Talker ASR Task on LibriMix and LibriSpeechMix
Please use the script `./Whisper-Sidecar/dataset/select_prompt_wav.py` to collect the enrolled prompt wav files under `./Whisper-Sidecar/dataset/enroll_audio`. 

The enrolled prompt audios will be concatenate with the overlapped speech with `DataCollatorSpeechSeq2SeqWithPadding`, if you set `--target_asr True` for the `finetune.py` and `evaluation.py` scripts.

## Usage

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd Whisper-Sidecar
python ./finetune.py     # training
python ./evaluation.py   # finetune
```

If you want to perform target-talker speech recognition, please set `--target_asr True` for `finetune.py` and `evaluation.py`.
